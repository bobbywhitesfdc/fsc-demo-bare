    <description>Create an Enhanced Post that includes more of the context that the business needs.  Should save a few mouse clicks to navigate back the original record.  Wow this is very limiting to only be able to include 4 fields.  Pretty useless.</description>
    <fields>Name</fields>
    <fields>StageName</fields>
    <fields>Amount</fields>
    <fields>CloseDate</fields>
    <label>Enhanced1</label>
</PostTemplate>
